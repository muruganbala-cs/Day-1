HTTP1.1

HTTP1.1 was Developed in 1989 by Timothy Berners-Lee
it is text based protocal
it allows single request and response  over a sinlge connecion
comparing HTTP1 it reduces bugs and errors
HTTP1.1 does not supports server push so client need to make requests every time 
it TCP handling is inefficency


HTTP2
it was Developed on 2015
it i binory based protocal
it allows multiple requestsin a single connecion      
comparing HTTP1.1 it reduces all errors
it supports server push, so client mank multiple requests is a single connection. it improves speed and efficency of the web applications
it allows client to specify a priority of requests, which can improve the responsiveness of the protocol and reduce latency.
