Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

HTTP1.1

HTTP1.1 was Developed in 1989 by Timothy Berners-Lee
it is a text-based protocol
it allows a single request and response  over a single connection
comparing HTTP1 it reduces bugs and errors
HTTP1.1 does not support server push so clients need to make requests every time 
it TCP handling is inefficiency
his receive window is advertised in a signal known as an ACK packet


HTTP2
it was Developed in 2015
it is the binary-based protocol
that allows multiple requests in a single connection      
comparing HTTP1.1 it reduces all errors
and supports server push, so the client mank multiple requests is a single connection. it improves the speed and efficiency of web applications
it allows clients to specify a priority of requests, which can improve the responsiveness of the protocol and reduce latency.
